# üß† Basic architecture
![architecture](/documents/architecture.png)

ZeroShotAgent uses the following tools for answering questions.
- **Get urls**: Returns pre-defined social media url.
- **Get recent tweets**: Returns the content of recent tweets. From this content, bot can reply to the recent interests and trends of the interviewee.
